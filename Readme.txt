#Early Stage Disease Diagnosis Using Human Nail in Image Processing
In this project we are testing the input nail image with the trained dataset using CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm.
After performing CNN classification it will determine whether the image is normal or abnormal one.
If it is abnormal it will show whether it is melanoma or onycholysis disease.

Step 1 : Download the source code from github or directly open it in github. 
Step 2 : Download the Anaconda Navigator.
Step 3 : Download all the packages required for this project.
Step 4 : In Anaconda Navigator select Environments and click on nail tab.
Step 5 : Then select open terminal option to open the command prompt.
Step 6 : In command prompt enter the project file location.
Step 7 : Then type "python cnn_train_test_.py" in command prompt to execute the project file.
Step 8 : Then close all the output window and the output result will be displayed in the command prompt.
